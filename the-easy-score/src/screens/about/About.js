                Here at EasyScore, we believe in working smarter, not harder. We
                accomplish this by using our intuitive and intelligent
                algorithm. We just happen to help you find the easiest teacher
                for each of your courses.

              <p>
                Using previous grade distributions we accurately predict how
                easily a specific teacher grades for each taught course on a
                scale from 0 to 100. The number next to each instructor is the
                instructor's score for that course and the number next to each
                course is the average score of all the teachers who have taught
                that course.
